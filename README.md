# MRPG
This is intended to be a game inspired by [Whispers in Akarra](http://akarra.com/), done from what
I can recollect of the game. And also changes to whatever I feel is easily improved upon.

## Requirements
There needs to be:
* a map-maker of some sort.
* a server-client setup
* possibility for multiple players to connect.
* Store player info, and some sort of registration.
* combat between players and mobs.
* PVP?
